# presentations
Repo containing presentations I've given + a template.

All presentations can be compiled with the latest texlive-full 
distribution, and the font "cmbright", which can be downloaded
at http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cmbright. Compile using pdflatex.

presentation_template:
 * This is a vary basic template for latex presentations, including figures, formulas and tables. 
 * Based on yet another template. 

functional_microcircuits:
 * Talk concerning feature specific networks and the changing 
 structure after the onset of visual stimuli, given for
 the seminar `Language and Brain`, January 2016.
 * Contains an algorithm to shrink pdf figures (see `convert.py`).

microcircuit:
 * Final presentation of the work I've done during my bachelor thesis.


### General comments:
Figures and the final presentations are not
uploaded (way too much data). 

A nice tool for presentations:
pdfpc -- includes infos for the presentation on a second screen

Useful alias for removing latex overhead (which is not 
uploaded anyways): 

alias rmlat="rm *.aux *.bbl *.bcf *.blg *.fdb_latexmk *.fls *.log *.nav *.out *.run.xml *.snm *.toc
"
